<img src="https://github.com/appsinacup/godot-rapier2d/blob/main/logo.jpg?raw=true"/> 

A 2d [rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) physics server for [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), implemented as a GDExtension.

# Limitations

- One way direction for CharacterBody2D missing.
- Static Body Constant Speed for CharacterBody2D and RigidBody2D missing.
- Spring Joint missing.
- Shape skewing missing.
- Shape Cast Margin isn't supported.

# Build Features

## Float Precision

This plugin is built for both single and double precision builds.

## Rapier Features

This package supports the following features of rapier ([more on this here](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/rust/getting_started)):

- simd-stable: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the wide crate. Has limited cross-platform support but can be used with a stable version of the Rust compiler.
- enhanced-determinism: enables cross-platform determinism (assuming the rest of your code is also deterministic) across all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms that implements the IEEE 754-2008 standard strictly. This includes most modern processors as well as WASM targets.

# Installation

- Automatic (Recommended): Download the plugin from the official [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2267) using the `AssetLib` tab in Godot.

- Manual: Download the github release and move only the `addons` folder into your project `addons` folder.

- Build it yourself. Read more about it in the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

After installing, go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Physics` -> `2D`. Change `Physics Engine` to `Rapier2D`.

# Roadmap

- Fix all other issues from Limitations.
