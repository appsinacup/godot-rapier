A 2D and 3D physics drop-in replacement for [godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) that adds stability and fluids. Uses [rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) for physics and [salva](https://github.com/dimforge/salva) for fluids.

# Note

This plugin was recently rewritten from c++ to rust. There are still some things missing from what it had originally and may have some new bugs that it didn't have before.

The reason it was rewritten is to do easier cross platform determinism part and exports to web.

# Features

- Better performance (parallel simulation and SIMD).
- Better stability.
- 2D and 3D.
- Fluids with surface tension, viscosity and elasticity.
- Liquids Missing

# Limitations

- SeparationRayShape2D, ConcavePolygonShape3D, HeightMapShape3D, 3D joints.
- Web exports.
- Android exports.
- Cross platform determinism.
- Double builds.

# Supported Platforms

- Windows (x86_64, x86_32)
- macOS (x86-64 + arm64 Universal)
- Linux (x86_64)
- *DISABLED* Android (x86_64, arm64)
- iOS (arm64)
- *DISABLED* Web (wasm32)

# Installation Rapier 2D

- Automatic (Recommended): Download the plugin from the official [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2267) using the `AssetLib` tab in Godot.

- Manual: Download the github release and move only the `addons` folder into your project `addons` folder.

After installing, go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Physics` -> `2D`. Change `Physics Engine` to `Rapier2D`.

# Installation Rapier 3D

- Automatic (Recommended): Download the plugin from the official [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2267) using the `AssetLib` tab in Godot.

- Manual: Download the github release and move only the `addons` folder into your project `addons` folder.

After installing, go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Physics` -> `3D`. Change `Physics Engine` to `Rapier3D`.
